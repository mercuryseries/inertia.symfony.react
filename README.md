# Symfony ❤️ Inertia.js

A quick way to setup a new Symfony Project with Inertia.js and React.js.

> **Note**
> For the script to work properly, the Symfony Client and npm must be available on your system.

## Minimal setup (without home/about pages and menu)

```shell
curl -s https://dub.sh/minimal-setup | bash -s -- myproject
```

## Full setup (with menu and home/about pages)

```shell
curl -s https://dub.sh/full-setup | bash -s -- myproject
```

`myproject` will have to be replaced by the name of yout project.
